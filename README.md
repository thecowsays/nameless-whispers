# vite-react-basic-template
A boilerplate template for ReactJS projects using Vite -- cleaned up and ready to code. Contains common directories complete with common components and stylesheets, associated imports, and dependencies listed in package.json.

**Note**: Utilizes SWC instead of Babel and pNpm instead of npm.

To install dependencies using pNpm (preferred), run:

`pnpm install`

To clone **only** the branch you wish to use, run:

`git clone --branch <branch-name-you-want> https://github.com/thecowsays/vite-react-basic-template.git <your-new-repo-name>`

## Main Branch Boilerplate
This template contains the most basic directories and components cleaned up and ready for coding. It is bundled using Vite for React + SWC.

### Directories & Components
Common components such as Header, Footer, and Homepage JSX files are in place within respective folders. Each file has the basic functional component syntax preset as well as associated stylesheets imported.

### Dependencies
The package.json contains:

- axios
- react-icons
- react-router-dom

## Other Boilerplates
View the different branches to see the different flavors available.

- **vrbt-norm** - a Modern Normalized CSS variant
- **vrbt-full-norm** - a full scaffolding for new projects including useState and useEffect and routing imports where appropriate along with the normalized CSS

**Note**: If you do not want normalized CSS, simply delete contents of *App.css*.

## Purpose & Intended Use
This was created for my personal use as a simple React boilerplate as a student of the Mimo Bootcamp program to aide in setting up projects quickly and efficiently. If it helps you, feel free to use it as you wish.
